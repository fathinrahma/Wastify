# Object Detection Process Steps

This README file provides an overview of the steps involved in the object detection process for our project. It explains how to prepare the data, initialize the model, perform feature extraction, classify objects,and obtain the final output.

## Steps

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that the input data is properly prepared for the detection task. This may involve resizing images, normalizing pixel values, or converting data formats.

2. **Model Initialization**: Initialize the pre-trained Xception model using TensorFlow. Load the weights and architecture of the pre-trained model to leverage its learned features.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Use TensorFlow to pass the input data through the Xception model. Extract high-level features from the input using the pre-trained model's layers. This step captures relevant patterns and information from the input data.

4. **Classification**: Utilize TensorFlow for object classification. Connect the extracted features to additional layers, such as fully connected layers, for the specific classification task. Assign labels to the detected objects based on the learned knowledge of the Xception model.

5. **Output**: Present the final results of the object detection process. This includes providing information such as the labels or classes assigned to the detected objects, along with confidence scores or bounding box coordinates.

## Usage

Follow the steps outlined above to ensure the successful execution of the object detection process. Make sure to have the necessary dependencies and libraries installed, including TensorFlow and the Xception model weights.

Refer to the code files and documentation for more detailed implementation instructions and specific functions or classes used in each step.
